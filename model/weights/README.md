# Download Model Weights

To access the model weights, we provide two options.

## From 🤗HuggingFace

Dyna-1 model weights (for both ESM-3 and ESM-2 versions) can be accessed through HuggingFace at <a href='https://huggingface.co/gelnesr/Dyna-1'>gelnesr/Dyna-1</a>. 

We recommend setting up and using `huggingface-cli` by running the following commands on the command line.

```
pip install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]"
huggingface-cli download gelnesr/Dyna-1 --include "weights/*" --local-dir model/
```

Another option is to use the `git clone` to download, set the download directory to `model/weights`. This will require doing the following:

```
git lfs install
git clone git@hf.co:gelnesr/Dyna-1
```

More info on how to download the model from HuggingFace can be found <a href='https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/models-downloading'>here</a>.
